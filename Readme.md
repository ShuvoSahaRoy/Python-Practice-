### Python Practice

This repo contains all basic codes and structures that
I have used during my python learning. I use this repo for my experiment with python. 

If you are visiting this repo right now, I will 
recommend you to check the awesome tasks directory. 

I have categorized everything, which is understandable from each directory name.
